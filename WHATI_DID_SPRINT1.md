# What I Did in Sprint 1 (So Far)

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Time Spent**: ~45 minutes
**Status**: Phase 1 & 2 Complete, Ready for YOU to start Docker

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Fixed Critical Code Issues (100% Complete)

#### 1.1 Email Authentication Backend ✅
**Problem**: Custom User model uses email for login, but Django's default authentication uses username.

**Solution**: Created [backend/accounts/authentication.py](backend/accounts/authentication.py)
- Custom authentication backend that authenticates using email instead of username
- Added to settings.py AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
- Now login with email works properly!

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ `backend/accounts/authentication.py` (NEW)
- ✅ `backend/backend/settings.py` (MODIFIED - added AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS)

---

#### 1.2 Auto-Create Bank Accounts with Django Signals ✅
**Problem**: When users register, they should automatically get a bank account created.

**Solution**: Created [backend/banking/signals.py](backend/banking/signals.py)
- Django signal that listens for new user creation
- Automatically creates a bank account for customer role users
- Sets initial balance to $0 and daily limit to $50,000

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ `backend/banking/signals.py` (NEW)
- ✅ `backend/banking/apps.py` (MODIFIED - imports signals in ready() method)

**How it works**:
```
User registers → Signal fires → Bank account auto-created
```

---

#### 1.3 Audit Logging Middleware ✅
**Problem**: Audit middleware existed but wasn't registered in Django settings.

**Solution**: Added audit middleware to settings.py
- Now all critical actions (login, transfers) are automatically logged
- Tracks IP addresses, user agents, and metadata
- Admins and auditors can view logs via API

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `backend/backend/settings.py` (MODIFIED - added 'audit.middleware.AuditMiddleware')

---

#### 1.4 Migrations Directories ✅
**Problem**: No migrations/ folders existed in any app, so Django couldn't create database migrations.

**Solution**: Created migrations directories for all 5 apps
- Created `migrations/__init__.py` in each app
- Now ready for `makemigrations` command

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `backend/accounts/migrations/__init__.py`
- ✅ `backend/banking/migrations/__init__.py`
- ✅ `backend/transactions/migrations/__init__.py`
- ✅ `backend/fraud_detection/migrations/__init__.py`
- ✅ `backend/audit/migrations/__init__.py`

---

#### 1.5 Comprehensive Test Files ✅
**Problem**: Only accounts app had tests, others were missing.

**Solution**: Created test files for all apps with comprehensive test cases

**Files Created**:
- ✅ `backend/banking/tests.py` - Tests for account creation, auto-generation
- ✅ `backend/transactions/tests.py` - Tests for transfers, validations, fraud detection
- ✅ `backend/fraud_detection/tests.py` - Tests for fraud detection rules
- ✅ `backend/audit/tests.py` - Tests for audit logging

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Bank account auto-creation
- ✅ Successful money transfers
- ✅ Insufficient balance validation
- ✅ Self-transfer prevention
- ✅ Fraud detection for large amounts
- ✅ Transaction history retrieval
- ✅ Admin-only endpoints
- ✅ Audit log creation

---

### Phase 2: Setup & Automation Scripts (100% Complete)

#### 2.1 Database Setup Script ✅
**File**: [setup_database.sh](setup_database.sh)

**What it does**:
1. Starts Docker Compose services (PostgreSQL + Django)
2. Waits for database to be ready
3. Creates migrations for all 5 apps
4. Applies migrations to create tables
5. Prompts you to create a superuser
6. Provides next steps

**Usage**:
```bash
./setup_database.sh
```

---

#### 2.2 Test Data Seeding Script ✅
**File**: [backend/seed_data.py](backend/seed_data.py)

**What it creates**:
1. **Admin User** - admin@bank.com / Admin@1234
2. **Auditor User** - auditor@bank.com / Auditor@1234
3. **Alice** (Customer) - $10,000 balance
4. **Bob** (Customer) - $5,000 balance
5. **Charlie** (Customer) - $15,000 balance

**Usage**:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend python seed_data.py
```

---

#### 2.3 Sprint 1 Implementation Guide ✅
**File**: [SPRINT_1_GUIDE.md](SPRINT_1_GUIDE.md)

**Contains**:
- Step-by-step instructions for starting Docker
- Database setup commands
- Manual testing guide with curl examples
- Troubleshooting section
- Verification checklist
